# ChurnPrediction
This project is a part of my study and road to become a data scientist. The data was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction?resource=download).

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
The primary objective of this machine learning project was to develop a predictive model that could accurately identify customers at risk of churn. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the goal was to provide actionable insights to the business, enabling them to proactively engage with customers and implement targeted retention strategies.
