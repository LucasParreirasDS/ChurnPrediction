# ChurnPrediction
This project is a part of my study and road to become a data scientist. The data was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction?resource=download).

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
The primary objective of this machine learning project was to develop a predictive model that could accurately identify customers at risk of churn. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the goal was to provide actionable insights to the business, enabling them to proactively engage with customers and implement targeted retention strategies.

### Methods Used
* Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* Visual Studio Code
* Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit learn, imblearn


## Project Description

### Approach
* **Data Analysis:** Our approach involves robust exploratory data analysis with pandas and seaborn to visualize behavior trends and gauge the importance of various features.
* **Predictive Modeling:** We employ machine learning algorithms to predict churn, placing particular emphasis on optimizing recall to minimize false negatives.

### Challenges and Considerations
* **Data Quality:** Ensuring the accuracy and integrity of our data is pivotal for generating reliable insights.
* **Class Imbalance:** Addressing the imbalanced nature of churn data to prevent skewed predictions.
* **Model Transparency:** Striking a balance between model complexity and interpretability to facilitate actionable decision-making.
* **External Dynamics:** Recognizing that external market dynamics can influence churn rates, adding complexity to our analysis.
